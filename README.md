# Deep Learning For Sport Image Classification

### Problem Statement
* Our problem is to create a series of supervised image classification models using pretrained convolutional neural networks and homegrown models. Upon completion of each models optimization, we will create a user input system or Streamlit interface where a user can upload a given sport image and receive back the top 3 predicted classes from all 4 models. For example, an image could be submitted, and a single model would return that it is 90% confident it is Figure Skating Men, 9% Figure Skating Women and 1% Figure Skating Pairs. Each other model would provide the same outputs. This interactive piece differentiates our project from other applications.
